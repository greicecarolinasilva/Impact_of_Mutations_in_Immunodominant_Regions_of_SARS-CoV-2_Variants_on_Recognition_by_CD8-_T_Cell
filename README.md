# Impact_of_Mutations_in_Immunodominant_Regions_of_SARS-CoV-2_Variants_on_Recognition_by_CD8-_T_Cell

In the study, we investigated in silico whether mutations in the immunodominant regions (IDR) of the S, M and N proteins of the Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 affect the recognition of viral antigens by CD8+ T cells. For this, a total of 71,639 Brazilian sequences were selected according to the criteria "completeness" and "high coverage" (accessed on August 31, 2023). Of these sequences, 36,174 belonged to the Gamma variant (P.1), 35,129 to the Delta variant (B.1.617+AY*) and 336 to the Omicron variant (BA.1). The consensus sequences were generated with the Geneious software using NC045512 as a reference.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all researchers and teams involved in the publication of the 71,639 Brazilian sequences analyzed in this study.  Your dedication in generating and sharing these sequences has been indispensable for advancing our understanding of the mutations in the immunodominant regions of S, M, and N proteins across different variants of SARS-CoV-2. Thank you for your invaluable contributions to the scientific community and efforts in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here are the DOIs containing all the sequences used in this study:

For Gamma variant (P.1): 

For Delta variant (B.1.617+AY*): 

For Omicron variant (BA.1):

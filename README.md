# Impact_of_Mutations_in_Immunodominant_Regions_of_SARS-CoV-2_Variants_on_Recognition_by_CD8-_T_Cell

In this study, we investigated whether mutations in the immunodominant regions (IDR) of the S, M and N proteins of the Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 influence the recognition of viral antigens by CD8+ T cells. For this purpose, a total of 71,639 Brazilian sequences were selected according to the criteria "completeness" and "high coverage" (accessed on August 31, 2023). Of these sequences, 36,174 belonged to the Gamma variant (P.1), 35,129 to the Delta variant (B.1.617+AY*) and 336 to the Omicron variant (BA.1). The consensus sequences were generated with the Geneious software using NC045512 as a reference.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the researchers and teams involved in the publication of the 71,639 Brazilian sequences analyzed in this study. Your dedication in generating and sharing these sequences has been invaluable to our understanding of the mutations in the immunodominant regions of the S, M and N proteins in the different variants of SARS-CoV-2. We thank you for your invaluable contributions to the scientific community and your efforts in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
